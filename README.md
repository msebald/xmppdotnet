==========

This repository contains source files for the public XMPP server list
at https://xmpp.net/

To request the addition of your server to the list, send a pull request
containing a vCard that describes your XMPP service (see the "vcards"
directory for examples). 

More detailed instructions are available here:

https://xmpp.net/register.php

After you submit your request, one of the repository administrators 
(currently @stpeter and @tfar) will send an email message verifying
the request to the [hostmaster|postmaster|webmaster] addresses at
the XMPP server domain (e.g., hostmaster@example.com).

If you have any questions, please post to the operators@xmpp.org list.
